  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive backend CRUD operations for notes and break reminders, along with frontend components for authentication, notes management, and break reminder settings. All three requirements (REQ-10, REQ-11, REQ-12) appear to be addressed with proper authentication flows, error handling, and UI feedback. The implementation follows the constraints by maintaining the shadow DOM content script architecture and keeping backend logic in main.mo.",
